# Crim-Lang

A small custom programming language interpreter.

## WARNING

This is a personal project project and not meant to be a full fledged programming language, this is being done for fun and personal interest.

Code is messy and yet to be commented.

There's litle to no documentation done.

There was no extensive testing yet, so there will be a lot of bugs.

-------------

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS 

Not everything will be working as it should.

Not everything is finished.

------------

## Current state

For now, all this can really do is recognize correct syntax and create a Syntax Tree.


Im currently working on creating Crim-VM, the virtual machine to which the Syntax Tree will be translated upon.

When that is done, I'll maybe try to improve many of the things I've done so far, including better organization of the code and commenting.

-----------

## Objectives

Crim's final syntax isn't really decided yet. I'm aiming towards a C-like language with some inspiration on python for now. This will probably change throughout development.

In general, my objectives with Crim are to be defined since I'm currently more focused on making it do something.

_Thanks for passing by!_
